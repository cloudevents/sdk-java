#  MQTT Support

The SDK supports both V3 and V5 MQTT binding specifications via these Java client libraries:

  * [Paho]()
  * [HiveMQ]()

NOTE: MQTT V3 *only* supports structured mode transfer of CloudEVents. Operations related to binary mode transmission
are either not available or will throw runtime exceptions if an attempt is made to use them.

Both client library implementations rely on a *provided* maven dependency.

# General Usage

There is a slight variance in usage between the two supported client libraries owing to the way those clients
have implemented support for the two versions of MQTT but the general pattern is the same as every other protocol
binding.

## Creating a message from a CloudEvent

  1. Obtain a `MessageWriter` from a factory.
  2. Use the writer to populate the MQTT message using structured or binary mode.
      * `mqttMessage = messageWriter.writeBinary(cloudEvent);` or,
      * `mqttMessage = messageWriter.writeStructured(cloudEvent, eventFormat);`

## Creating a CloudEvent from a message.

  1. Obtain a 'MessageReader' from a message factory for an MQTT message.
  2. Obtain a CloudEvent from the reader.
      * _CloudEvent cloudEvent = reader.toEvent();_


# PAHO Client Usage

</dependency>
```

# HiveMQ Client Usage

## Maven

```xml
