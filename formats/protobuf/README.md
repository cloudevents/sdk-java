# CloudEvents Protocol Buffers Format

This project provides functionality for the Java SDK to handle the
[protobuf format](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/protobuf-format.md).

The protobuf definition file is located in src/main/proto/spec.proto. The file was directly
copied from [https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/spec.proto]() and is built using
[the Maven proto plugin](https://www.xolstice.org/protobuf-maven-plugin/).
